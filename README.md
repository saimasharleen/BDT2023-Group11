---
***Abstract***

The project is a big data system to examine and represent email conversation records and extract meaningful observations from patterns, through a number of technologies, namely the Gmail API, PostgreSQL, SQLite, Kafka, Apache Spark and the Girvan-Newman algorithm.

##### Functionalities

- Data retrieval from a pre-existing email dataset
  
- Data retrieval through the Gmail API and assignation of a unique identifier to each sender and receiver

- Data pre-processing through Kafka
  
- Creation and population of a database either in PostgreSQL or SQLite, depending on the desidered features and resources constraints

- Analysis of the networks resulting from communication logs

- Interactive visualization
